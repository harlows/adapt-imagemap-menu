# adapt-imagemap-menu
An **Image Map Menu** written by Pete Stewart that mimics the [adapt-hotspot-menu](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-hotspot-menu) while falling back to the [adapt-contrib-boxmenu](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-boxmenu) on smaller devices. **Image Map Menu** also works in the Authoring Tool once [menu-map.jpg](https://github.com/harlows/adapt-imagemap-menu/blob/master/assets/menu-map.jpg) is added to the assets folder and [imagemapmenu.less](https://github.com/harlows/adapt-imagemap-menu/blob/master/less/imagemapmenu.less) is edited to position the hotspots.
